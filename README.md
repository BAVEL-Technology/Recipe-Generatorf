## Description

A web app that allows users to choose their own ingredients and generate recipes based off of those ingredients. Recipes are called from the Edamame API, and recipes are prioritized based off of how many ingredients each recipe contains (IE, recipes with more user-chosen ingredients get shown higher). This app uses Tailwindcss and flexbox for mobile responsiveness.
